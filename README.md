# coursera_getting_and_cleaning_data_project

Paulo Faleiros

This repository contains the following material referent to Getting and Cleaning Data course from Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization:
- codebook.MD: a code book explaining the contents of the data file and what the data is all about
- tidyDS.txt: a tidy dataset containing aggregated data for analysis, as described in the codebook
- run_analysis.R: an R script that generates analytical and summarized data as described in the codebook

The script run_analysis.R processes raw data samples from wearable devices, more specifically data from Samsumg Galaxy S accelerometer, from individuals performing some sorts of physical activities and resting states. The script collects from the raw datasets only the variables related to mean and SD for each measurement, combines and sorts data by activity and individual.
